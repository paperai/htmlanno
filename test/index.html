<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
There are a few characters that need to be treated differently when they are used in XHTML. This may be because they mean something special in XHTML (they are reserved characters), so they would be interpreted as part of the XHTML markup instead of content text. Or, it may be because they are characters beyond the standard (small) character set known as ASCII.
</p>


<h1>Method</h1>
<p>
You may not need to use any of these characters. If you want to use any of these characters in your content, you will have to include what is known as a “character entity.”
</p>


<h1>Experiments</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Be careful</a> with space around the character entities. They are often right next to other text, without any spaces. For instance, quotes should be right next to the text. Remember that the “&” and “;” characters are required. It is very easy to leave out the final semicolon “;”, but then your XHTML may not display properly.

Here is the XHTML for “this” paragraph:
